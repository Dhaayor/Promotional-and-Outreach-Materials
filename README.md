# üìÑ Print Promotional Materials Project

## üìù Project Overview
This project showcases a collection of print promotional materials designed for healthcare professionals (HCPs) and consumers. The materials include Patient Education Leaflets (PELs), Leave Behind Literature (LBLs), and social media content. Each piece is crafted to communicate complex medical information in an accessible and visually appealing way.

I contracted the design to an agency, but developed the content marketing strategy and directed the creative process of the brand kits and assest devlopement myself. This is also because of my graphics background as well. This features a bit of my marketing side. These are real brands with key information obstructed for privacy sake

## üé® Design Approach
### Visual Appeal
The design approach for each material is centered on creating an engaging and professional aesthetic. The visuals combine high-quality imagery, clear typography, and balanced layouts to ensure effective communication of key messages.
